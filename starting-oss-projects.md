Launching a new OSS project is comparable to a product introduction and it is, at first hand, a software development project - there is no difference to an internal software development project concerning planning, budget, staffing, testing etc. - the only difference is that everything happens in the public area. Be aware that publicly available source code is the “business card” of the organization to the software  ecosystem, and it is also the “business card” of its maintainers.

When thinking about to start an own OSS project there are several phases you should consider:


## Why to start an OSS project
The phase “why to start an OSS project” is very important and one shall have a clear picture about the “why” after this phase, because the answer to the “why” influences heavily subsequent decisions - like the license, whether to choose a CLA or DCO or “license-in =  license-out”, etc. [ToDo] add more

## Plan the OSS project
Prepare for launching the project
* Check source code
* REUSE conformance
* Define project governance:	
* charter
* code of conduct
* contribution guidelines
* CLA/DCO/...
* issue template
* PR template
* versioning
